# Web Scraping and Geotagging Project üåêüõ†Ô∏è

## Overview

Welcome to the Web Scraping and Geotagging Project! This repository delves into the fascinating world of web scraping, data processing, and geographical visualization using Python. Discover how to extract valuable information from web pages, manipulate data, and create interactive maps to visualize geospatial data effectively.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries: `requests`, `pandas`, `folium`, `beautifulsoup4`, `geopy`.

2. **Web Scraping:**
   - Use the provided code to scrape data from a target URL.
   - Extract relevant information like country names, capitals, populations, and areas.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Process the scraped data and prepare it for geotagging.
   - Zip columns to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates for mapping.

4. **Geotagging and Mapping:**
   - Utilize geopy to geotag locations based on their names.
   - Create an interactive map using Folium to visualize geospatial data.

5. **Upload Data to PostgreSQL:**
   - Upload the processed data to a PostgreSQL database for storage and further analysis.

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping:** Extract data from websites efficiently using Python libraries.
- **Data Processing:** Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis and visualization.
- **Geotagging:** Geotag locations to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Geospatial Visualization:** Create interactive maps to visualize geographical data.
