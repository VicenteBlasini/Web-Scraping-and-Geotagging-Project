# Web Scraping and Geotagging Project

## Overview

This project is a web scraping and geotagging tool that extracts data from a specified URL, processes the data, and then maps the geotags on an interactive map. It's designed to help users understand how to scrape web data, manipulate it, and visualize geographical information using Python.

The web scraping aspect focuses on extracting specific information from HTML pages, while the geotagging part involves assigning geographical coordinates to the extracted data based on locations mentioned in the scraped content. The final output is an interactive map that displays the geotagged data points.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`web_scraping_geotagging.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the code cells in the notebook to understand and run each part of the project.
5. After running the code cells, an HTML map file (`map.html`) will be generated.
6. Open the HTML map file in a web browser to view the interactive map.

## Key Concepts

- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from web pages using libraries like Beautiful Soup.
- **Geotagging**: Assigning geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to data points.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Folium and Leaflet.js to create interactive maps.

## How It Works

- **Scraping Data**: The project starts by scraping data from a specified URL using Beautiful Soup.
- **Data Processing**: Extracted data is processed and organized into a structured format.
- **Geotagging**: Geographical coordinates are obtained using Geopy based on the extracted locations.
- **Data Visualization**: The geotagged data is then visualized on an interactive map using Folium.
